This is a simple calculator project written in Java using TDD

This calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an approach to writing software where you first write tests that define what your code should do. Then, you write just enough code to make those tests pass. Finally, you refactor your code to improve its structure without changing its behavior. This cycle repeats for each new feature or modification, ensuring that your code is thoroughly tested and works as intended. TDD helps to catch bugs early, design cleaner code, and build confidence in your software's correctness.
